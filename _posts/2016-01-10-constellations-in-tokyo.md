Last week I had the opportunity to achieve a huge milestone. My first exhibition in Japan, Constellations, is now a reality thanks to the support of the Swatch Group. I am forever grateful and a proud former artist in residence in the Swatch Art Peace Hotel. The exhibition is open to the public in the Swatch Group building in Ginza until the 18th of November.
