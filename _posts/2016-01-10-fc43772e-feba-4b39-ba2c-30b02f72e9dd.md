Singapore's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), the National Archives and LASALLE will be presenting an exhibition of photographic works by George Porter, an American reporter that was resident of Singapore from 1965 to 1970\. The exhibition will also show some works from other artists and I have been selected as one of them. George Porter was interested in the life of the people of Singapore and my work will try to portrait the rich diversity of this country. A part of my installation requires to photograph with an old Polaroid camera 400 people that are currently living in Singapore. I will be walking the streets of Singapore with my camera to collect voluntaries, but I am also inviting, everybody interested in participating, to visit my studio this coming Saturday 22nd of August from 10 am to 1pm. Open to all ages! (Jordi Studio: 8 Jalan Kilang Barat, \#07-06, Central Link, 159351)
